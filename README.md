# SHA3SHAKE

## Description

The SHA3SHAKE class is a Java implementation of the SHA-3 and SHAKE 
cryptographic hash functions based on the Keccak algorithm. It uses the sponge construction, 
where data is absorbed and then squeezed to produce the final output. This class allows for both 
SHA-3 (with specific bit lengths like 224, 256, 384, and 512) and SHAKE (with variable output 
lengths of 128 or 256). Below is a detailed breakdown of the program. There are no known 
shortcomings at this time other than to say that the contents of the encrypted and decrypted files 
are not echoed to the terminal..
